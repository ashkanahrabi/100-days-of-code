# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Developed a "Loading" ([see the design on Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/460211655661367029/)) with pure CSS (has Animations for sure üòÅ)

**Thoughts:** Actually today's code had no special CSS challenge for me, but the amazing part was to handle the mathematical calculations and figuering out how to develop the animation and movements so that it feels like dots are going inside each other.
