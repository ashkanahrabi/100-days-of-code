# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Developed a "Loading" ([see the design on Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/460211655661367029/)) with pure CSS (has Animations for sure üòÅ)

**Thoughts:** Actually today's code had no special CSS challenge for me, but the amazing part was to handle the mathematical calculations and figuering out how to develop the animation and movements so that it feels like dots are going inside each other.

### Day 2: December 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I've started TypeScript. I'm developing a validation package. Today I just developed a small part of with.

**Thoughts:** TS is amazing for me. I really like to master it and that's why I decieded to develop this package with TS. The package itself is a huge project. I may need to work on it for few days.
