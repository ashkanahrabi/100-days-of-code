# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Developed a "Loading" ([see the design on Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/460211655661367029/)) with pure CSS (has Animations for sure üòÅ)

**Thoughts:** Actually today's code had no special CSS challenge for me, but the amazing part was to handle the mathematical calculations and figuering out how to develop the animation and movements so that it feels like dots are going inside each other.

### Day 2: December 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I've started TypeScript. I'm developing a validation package. Today I just developed a small part of with.

**Thoughts:** TS is amazing for me. I really like to master it and that's why I decieded to develop this package with TS. The package itself is a huge project. I may need to work on it for few days.

----------------------------

### Day 3: December 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I've added a new util function (for converting English nums to Persian nums) to my package, `Palidate.js`.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a bit strange with TS üòÖ But it's really helpful and as I develop more on my package, I learn more and that sounds great.

----------------------------

### Day 4: December 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Another util function (for formatting currency) for my package, `Palidate.js`. Although it is buggy and needs some improvements.

**Thoughts:** In many cases (specially when typing Persian inside an input) you can not use `toLocaleString()` function. And this util function is very helpful there. I decided to develop things that are useful for other developers. Finally, TS is pleasing for me üòå.

----------------------------

### Day 5: December 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today as I was too busy, I decided to do one of `Codewars` challenges.

**Thoughts:** These challenges are really amazing for me and I like to improve my data structure and algorithm knowledge.

### Day 6: December 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Back to my package `Palidate.js` üôÉ. I've added my first validation function (isNationalCode) to it.

**Thoughts:** My fears of developing in TypeScript is gone and I'm really getting used to it. My package is also getting more completed.

----------------------------

### Day 7: December 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Well, every package needs tests and I'm writing tests for it using jest and `ts-jest`. 

**Thoughts:** Writing tests feels like being in a safe place to take off your pants ü§£. I was familiar with jest from past but now I'm trying to master it.

### Day 8: December 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Nothing special, just working on unit tests as yesterday 

**Thoughts:** Hmmm, I need to investigate on more test cases.

### Day 9: December 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: New validation function added. It's for validating Iranian mobile numbers.

**Thoughts:** Everything's ok unless I need to learn more on TypeScript.
